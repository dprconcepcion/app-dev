### **Cast >**
-  **Heath Ledger** as *Patrick Verona* 
-  **Julia Stiles** as *Kat Stratford* 
-  **Joseph Gordon-Levitt** as *Cameron James*
-  **Larisa Oleynik** as *Bianca Stratford*

### Among the most well-known quotes from this film is:
*I hate the way you're always right
I hate it when you lie
I hate it when you make me laugh
Even worse when you make me cry
I hate it when you're not around
And the fact that you didn't call*
**But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you**
*Not even close
Not even a little bit
Not even at all*

### 10 Things I love about this film:
1. *Kat Stratford* 
2. The sweet puppy dog face of little *Cameron James*
3. The sh*t hath hitith the fan... ith
4. Dad, it's just a party. -- And Hell is just a sauna.
5. "I know you can be overwhelmed, and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be...whelmed? -- I think you can in Europe!"
6. "I guess in this society being a male and an a**hole makes you worthy of our time" - gosh this line has aged so damn well wow.
7. *Kat Stratford* being a witty and nasty throughout most of the film
8. MY INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER PMS (the dad is so iconic in this lol)
9. *Larisa* punching *Joey* twice then proceeding to kiss *Cameron* (warmed my heart more than it should have).
10. *Patrick Verona* singing **"Can't Take My Eye's Off You"**
